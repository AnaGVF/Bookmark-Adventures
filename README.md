Bookmark-Adventures

A 2D adventure videogame I made for the "Programming Paradigms" class I took at University on my 4th Semester.

Tom, the main character, is a very disorganized boy. One day he trips over a pile of books and falls inside them. Tom has to collect the missing ripped pages from his books before he gets stuck there forever or gets killed!

The game features 2 levels where Tom has to stay safe, find the missing pages and get out from there before the time finishes.

Tom can collect good and bad items, which affect his health and performance overall.

Made with PyGame and Python.
