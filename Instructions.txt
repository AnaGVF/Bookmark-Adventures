Welcome to the Bookmark Adventures videogame!

Thank you for downloading Bookmark Adventures. In order to play the game, you must have Python and PyGame
installed.
In order to install Python, follow this link to get started: https://www.python.org/downloads/
In order to install Pygame: just type "pip install pygame" on your console.

These are the Python and PyGame versions I used to make this game:

- Python Version 3.7.4
- Pygame Version 1.9.6

When you have everything installed, run it from your console (make sure the directory is set right) and 
run the main.py file.
